# ONE-OUT-
It is a small mini project created in Python. It is a basic one, created just for a thorough understanding of all the concepts learnt. 

In this mini project, first the code will ask the number of players who are playing the game and then the max_score which they need to achieve for winning this game. 
Each player will get a chance to roll the dice, if they get a 1, there total score = 0, otherwise it keeps adding up... 

In this I used concept of while, for loop and also input, output stuff with calling random as well for rolling a dice.
